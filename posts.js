        My past javascript is contained to what I have learned here at UVU and from some freelance web development. My favorite part of web development is the fact \
        that I get to solve problems and be creative at the same time. I hope to gain a more in-depth knowledge about javascript because there are so many intricacies  \
        within the language, and who doesn't want to become a javascript wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?",

        bodyOne: "So what's this thing called the JAMstack? Well, it's a fairly new topic in the web development world that has created a lot of buzz. The stack \
        isn't so much about specific technologies like traditional stack i.e. (Lamp, Mern, Mevn, etc.), rather it is a new terminology. JAMstack stands for Javascript \
        Api's Markup. This new ecosystem of tools streamlines web development, delivers improved performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience.",

        bodyTwo: 'But how exactly does this work? Well, JAMstack utilizes Javascript, Apis, and marku pto build blazing fast static sites that aren\'t all that static anymore. \
          This new set of modern technologies provides you with all of the featues you need to build static sites that appear to be dynamic sites. <br/> <br/> In most web architectures, the \
          front-end is coupled with the server. Each time you request a new page it as to contact the server, which gives you the data from the server and it is then parsed into HTML, \
          traveling through the network. <br/> <br/> When using the JAMstack, there isn\'t a need to build a page for each request. With JAMstack, the client requests the page once and is \
          delivered with the pre-rendered page. <br/> <br/> For example, my website is utilizing the JAMstack using nuxt that builds a server-rendered Vue.js application and SPA (best of both worlds) \
          and hosted over Netlify using a subdomian from my custom domain name. I wanted to use Nuxt, because like I said, it is the best of both worlds for a server-rendered application and single page \
          application. Also, I am familiar with Vue.js so it was an easy setup.',
